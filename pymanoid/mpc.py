class LinearPredictiveControl(object):

    """
    Predictive control for a system with linear dynamics and linear
    constraints.

    The discretized dynamics of a linear system are described by:

    .. math::

        x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k

    where :math:`x` is assumed to be the first-order state of a configuration
    variable :math:`p`, i.e., it stacks both the position :math:`p` and its
    time-derivative :math:`\\dot{p}`. Meanwhile, the system is linearly
    constrained by:

    .. math::

        x_0 & = x_\\mathrm{init} \\\\
        \\forall k, \\ C_k x_k + D_k u_k & \\leq e_k \\\\

    The output control law minimizes a weighted combination of two types of
    costs:

    - Terminal state error
        :math:`\\|x_\\mathrm{nb\\_steps} - x_\\mathrm{goal}\\|^2`
        with weight :math:`w_{xt}`.
    - Cumulated state error:
        :math:`\\sum_k \\|x_k - x_\\mathrm{goal}\\|^2`
        with weight :math:`w_{xc}`.
    - Cumulated control costs:
        :math:`\\sum_k \\|u_k\\|^2`
        with weight :math:`w_{u}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array, shape=(n, n)
        State linear dynamics matrix.
    B : array, shape=(n, dim(u))
        Control linear dynamics matrix.
    x_init : array, shape=(n,)
        Initial state as stacked position and velocity.
    x_goal : array, shape=(n,)
        Goal state as stacked position and velocity.
    nb_steps : int
        Number of discretization steps in the preview window.
    C : array, shape=(m, dim(u)), list of arrays, or None
        Constraint matrix on state variables. When this argument is an array,
        the same matrix `C` is applied at each step `k`. When it is ``None``,
        the null matrix is applied.
    D : array, shape=(l, n), or list of arrays, or None
        Constraint matrix on control variables. When this argument is an array,
        the same matrix `D` is applied at each step `k`. When it is ``None``,
        the null matrix is applied.
    e : array, shape=(m,), list of arrays
        Constraint vector. When this argument is an array, the same vector `e`
        is applied at each step `k`.
    wxt : scalar, optional
        Weight on terminal state cost, or ``None`` to disable.
    wxc : scalar, optional
        Weight on cumulated state costs, or ``None`` to disable (default).
    wu : scalar, optional
        Weight on cumulated control costs.

    Notes
    -----
    In numerical analysis, there are three classes of methods to solve boundary
    value problems: single shooting, multiple shooting and collocation. The
    solver implemented in this class follows the `single shooting method
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_method>`_.
