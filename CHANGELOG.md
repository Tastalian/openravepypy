# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Add an example for recording joint angle data to the simulation documentation
- Document joint acceleration limits in inverse kinematics
- Examples are now part of the documentation
- Updated VHIP stabilization example to match [ICRA 2020 video](https://scaron.info/videos/icra-2020.mp4)

## [1.2.0] - 2019/10/26

### Added

- Body: ``pos``, ``rotation_matrix`` and ``transform`` aliases
- Body: compute the adjoint matrix in ``body.adjoint_matrix``
- Contact: ``contact.normal`` alias
- Contact: ``set_wrench()`` function that switches a contact to managed mode
- Contact: ``wrench_at()`` function to get wrench at a given point in the world frame
- Contact: ``wrench``, ``force`` and ``moment`` attributes
- Example: [external force](examples/external_force.py) acting on the right hand of the humanoid
- Example: [stabilization with height variations](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02289919v1/document)
- InvertedPendulum: draw center of pressure by ``draw_point``
- Manipulator: ``wrench``, ``force`` and ``moment`` attributes
- Robot: stance binding creates a new ``robot.wrench_distributor`` process
- Simulation: can now ``unschedule()`` a process
- StanceWrenchDistributor class to distribute contact wrenches of a stance

### Changed

- CameraRecorder: ``wait_for()`` does not require ``sim`` argument any more
- InvertedPendulum: clamping is enabled/disabled by ``self.clamp``
- InvertedPendulum: clamping is now the default behavior for ``set_cop`` and ``set_lambda``
- RobotWrenchDrawer became RobotDiscWrenchDrawer (discrete velocity differentiation)
- RobotWrenchDrawer now fetches results from stance wrench distributor
- License: switched to GPL as cddlib (and thus pypoman) is GPLv2
- Updated qpsolvers submodule to v1.0.7

### Fixed

- GUI: don't draw zero wrenches
- Video recording and conversion script

## [1.1.0] - 2019/04/30

### Added

- Example: [horizontal walking](examples/horizontal_walking.py) by linear model predictive control
- IK: can now take joint acceleration limits into account
- IK: upgraded with Levenberg-Marquardt damping
- IK: warm-start parameter to ``solve()``
- Point: new attribute ``point.pdd`` for the acceleration
- Point: new function ``point.integrate_constant_jerk()``
- Robot model gets a ``get_link()`` function
- Simulation gets ``set_camera_transform()`` function
- SwingFoot type: a polynomial swing foot interpolator
- This change log
- ZMP support areas can now take optional contact pressure limits

### Changed

- Contact: ``copy()`` now takes optional ``hide`` keyword argument
- GUI: default point size is now 1 cm
- GUI: renamed ``draw_polyhedron()`` to ``draw_polytope()``
- IK: task strings now print both weight and gain coefficients
- MPC: can now pass optional arguments to the QP solver in ``solve()``
- MPC: no need to call the ``build()`` function any more
- Removed outdated [Copra](https://github.com/vsamy/copra/) wrapper
- Stance: now bind end-effector links as well
- Stance: simplified prototype of ``compute_zmp_support_area``

### Fixed

- IK: singularity fix from [Pfeiffer et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2018.2855265)
- Knee joint names in JVRC-1 model
- Python 3 compatibility
- Restore initial settings in IK solve()

## [1.0.0] - 2018/10/17

### Added

- Initial release of the project. Let's take it from there.
